# Getting Started

useAuth is designed to be quick to setup. You'll need an Auth0 account with an app domain and client id.


## 1. Install the hook

```js
$ yarn add react-use-auth
```

Downloads from npm, adds to your package.json, etc. You can use npmas well.


## 2. Set up AuthProvider


useAuth uses an AuthProvidercomponent to configure the Auth0 client and share state between components. It's using React context with a reducer behind the scenes, but that's an implementation detail.

I recommend adding this around your root component. In Gatsby that's done in gatsby-browser.jsand gatsby-ssr.js. Yes useAuthis built so it doesn't break server-side rendering. ✌️

But of course server-side "you" will always be logged out.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { navigate } from "gatsby"

import { AuthProvider } from "react-use-auth"

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
    <AuthProvider
      navigate={navigate}
      auth0_domain="useauth.auth0.com"
      auth0_client_id="GjWNFNOHqlino7lQNjBwEywalaYtbIzh"
    >
      {element}
      </AuthProvider>
)
```

```<AuthProvider>``` creates a context, sets up a state reducer, initializes an Auth0 client and so on. Everything you need for authentication to work in your whole app :)

The API takes a couple config options:

```navigate``` – your navigation function, used for redirects. I've tested with Gatsby, but anything should work

```auth0_domain``` – from your Auth0 app

```auth0_client_id``` – from your Auth0 app

```auth0_params``` – an object that lets you overwrite any of the default Auth0 client parameters

PS: even though Auth doesn't do anything server-side, useAuth will throw errors during build, if its context doesn't exist

By default ```useAuth```'s Auth0 client uses these params:

```jsx
const params = {
    domain: auth0_domain,
    clientID: auth0_client_id,
    redirectUri: `${callback_domain}/auth0_callback`,
    audience: `https://${auth0_domain}/api/v2/`,
    responseType: "token id_token",
    scope: "openid profile email"
}
```

```domain``` and ```clientID``` come from your props.

```redirectUri``` is set to use the ```auth0_callbackpage``` on the current domain. Auth0 redirects here after users login so you can set cookies and stuff. useAuthwill handle this for you ✌️

```audience``` is set to use api/v2. I know this is necessary but honestly have been copypasting it through several of my projects.

```responseType``` same here. I copy paste this from old projects so I figured it's a good default.

```scope``` you need openid for social logins and to be able to fetch user profiles after authentication. Profile and Email too. You can add more via the ```auth0_params``` override.

## 3. Create the callback page


Auth0 and most other authentication providers use OAuth. That requires redirecting your user to their login form. After login, the provider redirects the user back to your app.

Any way of creating React pages should work, here's what I use for Gatsby.

The goal is to load a page, briefly show some text, and run the ```handleAuthentication``` method from useAuthon page load.

That method will create a cookie in local storage with your user's information and redirect back to homepage. Redirecting to other post-login pages currently isn't supported but is a good idea now that I thought of it 🤔

PS: Make sure you add ```domain/auth0_callback``` as a valid callback URL in your Auth0 config

## 4. Enjoy useAuth


You're ready to use useAuthfor authentication in your React app.

Here's a login button for example:

```jsx
const Login = () => {
    const { isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth()

    if (isAuthenticated()) {
        return <Button onClick={logout}>Logout</Button>
    } else {
        return <Button onClick={login}>Login</Button>
    }
}
```

```isAuthenticated``` is a method that checks if the user's cookie is still valid. loginand logouttrigger their respective actions.

You can even say hello to your users:

```jsx
// src/pages/index.js

const IndexPage = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth()

  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title="Home" />
        <h1>Hi {isAuthenticated() ? user.name : "people"}</h1>
  )
}
```

Check ```isAuthenticated``` then use the user object. Simple as that.
